Paige Braymer - Section 3 - Dr. Eloe / 10am

I am a junior majoring in Computer Science with general emphasis.

I am from Chillicothe, Missouri and have a background in IT and system administration. My interests include: video games, compiliers and baking.

My career plan, as of now, is to continue education and become a professor/researcher.

Something interesting about me is that when I was three, a pencil almost blinded my left eye.
